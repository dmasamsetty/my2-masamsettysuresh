# Dimple Masamsetty Suresh

I have an intresting name ,let me start with that,Dimple.Its just the fun factor that they say i am named after the famous actress Dimple Kapadia.I live in chennai(Tamil Nadu) but i have grown up in Ramagundam(Telangana) . I was more into dancing and singing till my tenth grade.But from there dancing has become my passion where i am yet to achieve that in life. I pursued engineering in KL university and was placed in an IT company Infosys.So I got an experience of 2 years. Now i am here to do masters of science in applied Computer science.
